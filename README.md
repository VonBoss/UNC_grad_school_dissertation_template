## Dissertation template

The provided word template and example dissertation follow the UNC Graduate School guidelines found in the [UNC dissertation style guide 2024]('UNC_dissertation_style_guide.pdf'). NOTE: The example dissertation was accepted by the UNC Graduate school in June 2025.

For more information on dissertation formatting consult the [UNC Thesis and Dissertation Guide](https://gradschool.unc.edu/academics/thesis-diss/guide/), [UNC_dissertation_style_guide.pdf](https://github.com/VonBoss/UNC_grad_school_dissertation_template/blob/main/UNC_dissertation_style_guide.pdf), and [UNC Dissertation formatting workshop video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO_zU3neado&ab_channel=UNC-ChapelHillGraduateSchool) .

### How to: table of contents and list of figures

Adding both the Table of contents (TOC) and a list of figures/tables (with titles and page numbers) requires some specific formatting. For example, you need to use the Word headings options to automate the creation of a TOC. I attempted to explain how some of these formatting ticks in comment boxes in the dissertation template. However, to fully learn how to properly use the included template to create a table of contents and list of figures I recommend watching the [Dissertation formatting workshop video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO_zU3neado&ab_channel=UNC-ChapelHillGraduateSchool).

## Abbrev and symbols template

The Grad School requires that you include a table that defines the abbreviation and symbols contained in your dissertation.

The included `abbreviations_symbols_list_template.xlsx` is designed to help you quickly generate definitions for common Chemistry abbrev and symbols. The template file can be downloaded from github and opened using Excel.


### Example abbrev and symbols table:

| Abbrev/symbol | Definition            |
| ------------- | --------------------- |
| ±             | plus/minus            |
| °             | degree                |
| g             | gram                  |
| K             | Kelvin                |
| µm            | micrometer            |
| µM            | micromolar            |
| DMF           | N-N-dimethylformamide |

## Reference published dissertations

You can find published UNC dissertations from previous students and labmates on [ProQuest](https://guides.lib.unc.edu/go.php?c=23608468).

I recommend using the `Author` and `Advisor` fields to find dissertations published by your lab of interest.
